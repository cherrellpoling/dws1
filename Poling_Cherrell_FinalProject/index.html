			<p>In the 15th century, commonplace books, popular in England, emerged as a way to compile 
				information that included recipes, quotations, letters, poems and more. Each commonplace 
				book was unique to its creator's particular interests. Friendship albums became popular 
				in the 16th century. These albums were used much like modern day yearbooks, where friends 
				or patrons would enter their names, titles and short texts or illustrations at the request 
				of the album's owner. These albums were often created as souvenirs of European tours and 
				would contain local memorabilia including coats of arms or works of art commissioned by 
				local artisans. Starting in 1570, it became fashionable to incorporate colored plates 
				depicting popular scenes such as Venetian costumes or Carnival scenes. These provided 
				affordable options as compared to original works and, as such, these plates were not sold 
				to commemorate or document a specific event, but specifically as embellishments for albums.
				In 1775, James Granger published a history of England with several blank pages at the end 
				of the book. The pages were designed to allow the book's owner to personalize the book with 
				his own memorabilia. </p>

				<p>The practice of pasting engravings, lithographs and other illustrations into books, or 
				even taking the books apart, inserting new matter, and rebinding them, became known as 
				extra-illustrating or grangerizing. Additionally, friendship albums and school yearbooks 
				afforded girls in the 18th and 19th centuries an outlet through which to share their 
				literary skills, and allowed girls an opportunity to document their own personalized 
				historical record previously not readily available to them.</p>

				<p> The advent of modern photography began with the first permanent photograph created by 
				Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826. This allowed the average person to begin to 
				incorporate photographs into their scrapbooks.</p>

				<p>Old scrapbooks tended to have photos mounted with photomounting corners and perhaps 
				notations of who was in a photo or where and when it was taken. 
				They often included bits of memorabilia like newspaper clippings, letters, etc.</p>

			<h2 id= "modern">Modern Scrapbooking</h2>


				<p>Marielen Christensen (pronounced as the names "Mary Ellen"), of Elk Ridge, Utah 
				(formerly of Spanish Fork) is often credited with turning scrapbooking from what was once
				just the age-old scrapbook hobby into the actual industry containing businesses devoted 
				specifically to the sale and manufacturing of scrapbooking supplies. She began designing 
				creative pages for her family's photo memories, inserting the completed pages into sheet 
				protectors collected in 3-ring binders. By 1980, she had assembled over fifty volumes 
				and was invited to display them at the World Conference on Records in Salt Lake City. 
				Marielen and her husband A.J. (who now celebrate 50 years of marriage as of December 6, 
				2013) authored and published a how-to book, Keeping Memories Alive, and opened a 
				scrapbook store in Spanish Fork in 1981 that remains open today.</p>



				<p>In addition to preserving memories, the hobby is popular for the strong social network 
				that scrapbooking can provide.[8] Hobbyists, known as "scrappers" or "scrapbookers," get 
				together and scrapbook at each other's homes, local scrapbook stores, scrapbooking 
				conventions, retreat centers, and even on cruises. The attendees share tips and ideas 
				as well as enjoying a social outlet. The term "crop," a reference to cropping or trimming 
				printed photographs, was coined to describe these events.
				The scrapbooking industry doubled in size between 2001 and 2004 to $2.5 billion with over 
				1,600 companies creating scrapbooking products by 2003. Creative Memories, a home-based 
				retailer of scrapbooking supplies founded in 1987, saw $425 million in retail sales in 2004.</p>

				<p>Many stores have popped up and cater to the scrapbooking community. These shops provide 
				all of the necessary tools for every scrap booker's needs. Specialized independent seller 
				companies have also become part of the craze. These include companies such as 
				"Making Memories", "Creative Memories", "Stamp It Up" and "Close to my Heart".</p>

				<h3>Scrapbooking materials</h3>
			</hgroup>
		
			<p>The most important scrapbooking supply is the album itself, which can be permanently bound, 
			or allow for the insertion of pages. There are other formats such as mini albums and 
			accordion-style fold-out albums. Some of these are adhered to various containers, such as 
			matchbooks, CD cases, or other small holders. When scrap artists started moving away from 
			the "page" and onto alternative surfaces and objectives, they termed these creations 
			"altered items" or now simply called "off-the-page". This movement circles back to the 
			history of art from the 1960s when Louise Nevelson was doing "Assemblages" with found 
			objects and recycled parts.</p>

			<p>Modern scrapbooking is done largely on 12 inch (30 cm) square or letter-size 
			(US Letter (8.5 by 11 inch) or A4 (210 by 297 mm)) pages. More recently, smaller albums 
			have become popular. The most common new formats are 6, 7, or 8-inch (15, 17.5, or 20 cm) 
			square. It is important to many scrappers to protect their pages with clear page protectors.</p>

			<p>Basic materials include background papers (including printed and cardstock paper), 
			photo corner mounts (or other means of mounting photos such as adhesive dots, 
			photo mounting tape, or acid-free glue), scissors, a paper trimmer or cutting tool, 
			art pens, archival pens for journaling, and mounting glues (like thermo-tac). More 
			elaborate designs require more specialized tools such as die cut templates, rubber stamps, 
			craft punches, stencils, inking tools, eyelet setters, heat embossing tools and personal 
			die cut machines. A lot of time people who enjoy scrapbooking will create their own 
			background papers by using the tools mentioned along with "fancy" textured succors.</p>

			<p>Various accessories, referred to as "embellishments", are used to decorate scrapbook pages. 
			Embellishments include stickers, rub-ons, stamps, eyelets, brads, chipboard elements in 
			various shapes, alphabet letters, lace, wire, fabric, beads, sequins, and ribbon. The use 
			of die cut machines is also increasingly popular; in recent years a number of electronic 
			die-cutting machines resembling a plotter with a drag knife have hit the market(e.g. The 
			Cricut), enabling scrappers to use their computer to create die cuts out of any shape or 
			font with the use of free or third party software. Scrapbook makers will also use magazine 
			clippings to "decorate" their scrapbook pages.</p>

			<p>One of the key components of modern scrapbooking is the archival quality of the supplies. 
			Designed to preserve photographs and journaling in their original state, materials 
			encouraged by most serious scrapbookers are of a higher quality than those of many 
			typical photo albums commercially available. Scrappers insist on acid-free, 
			lignin-free papers, stamp ink, and embossing powder. They also use pigment-based inks, 
			which are fade resistant, colorfast, and often waterproof. Many scrappers use buffered 
			paper, which will protect photos from acid in memorabilia used in the scrapbook. Older 
			"magnetic" albums are not acid-free and thus cause damage to the photos and memorabilia 
			included in them. Gloves, too, are used to protect photos from the oil on hands.
			An international standard, ISO 18902, provides specific guidelines on materials that are 
			safe for scrapbooking through its requirements for albums, framing, and storage materials. 
			ISO 18902 includes requirements for photo-safety and a specific pH range for acid-free 
			materials. ISO 18902 prohibits the use of harmful materials, including  <abbr title= "Polyvinyl 
			chloride"> PVC</abbr> and Cellulose nitrate.</p>

				<h3>Digital scrapbooking</h3>

			<p>The advent of scanners, desktop publishing, page layout programs, and advanced printing 
			options make it relatively easy to create professional-looking layouts in digital form. 
			The internet allows scrapbookers to self-publish their work. Scrapbooks that exist 
			completely in digital image form are referred to as "digital scrapbooks" or "computer 
			scrapbooks."</p>


			<p>A digital scrapbook layout that demonstrates the use of numerous digital "materials"
			While some people prefer the physicality of the actual artifacts they paste onto the pages 
			of books, the digital scrapbooking hobby has grown in popularity in recent years. 
			Some of the advantages include a greater diversity of materials, less environmental 
			impact, cost savings, the ability to share finished pages more readily on the internet, 
			and the use of image editing software to experiment with manipulating page elements in 
			multiple ways without making permanent adjustments. A traditional scrapbook layout may 
			employ a background paper with a torn edge. While a physical page can only be torn once 
			and never restored, a digital paper can be torn and untorn with ease, allowing the 
			scrapbooker to try out different looks without wasting supplies. Some web-based digital 
			scrapbooks include a variety of wallpapers and backgrounds to help the users create a 
			rich visual experience. Each paper, photo, or embellishment exists on its own layer in 
			your document, and you can reposition them at your discretion.</p>

			<p>Furthermore, digital scrapbooking is not limited to digital storage and display. Many 
			digital scrappers print their finished layouts to be stored in scrapbook albums. 
			Others have books professionally printed in hard bound books to be saved as keepsakes. 
			Professional printing- and binding-services offer free software to create scrapbooks 
			with professional layouts and individual layout capabilities. Because of the integrated 
			design and order workflow, real hardcover bound books can be produced more cost effectively.</p>

			<p>Early digital scrapbooks were created from digital photos uploaded to an external site. 
			Over time, this moved to a model of downloading software onto a personal computer that 
			will organize photos and help create the digital scrapbook. With the growth of Web 2.0 
			functionality, digital scrapbooking is going back online, to avoid the hassles of having 
			to download and install PC software. The availability of cheap online storage 
			(e.g., on Amazon's S3 service), and the desire to leverage pre-uploaded online albums 
			(e.g., on Yahoo's Flickr) make it more convenient for users to directly compose their 
			digital scrapbooks online. Print on demand fulfillment enables such digital scrapbooks 
			to effectively supplant traditional scrapbooks.</p>

			<p>Digital scrapbooking has advanced to the point where digital scrapbook layouts may be 
			made entirely online using Web-based software. Users upload their photos, create a 
			digital scrapbook layout using a Web page and digital scrapbook graphics. The layout 
			can then be downloaded as a low-resolution JPEG file for sharing on the Web or as a 
			high-resolution JPEG file for printing.</p>

			<h2 id= "industry">Scrapbooking industry statistics</h2>


			<p>Some people attribute the increased interest in scrapbooking to a renewed passion for 
			genealogy, while others say that it is an outlet for those interested in photography 
			and graphic design.</p>
	
			<p>For evidence of interest in scrapbooking, consider the following facts:</p>

			<p>Over 4 million women in the United States alone consider themselves to be scrapbookers.
			Over 4% of all women in U.S. have done traditional scrapbooking. Millions of others do 
			various aspects of photo books but are not scrapbookers. </p>

			<p>Scrapbooking is one of the largest categories within the craft and hobby industry and now
			considered to be the third most popular craft in the nation. From 1996 through 2004, sales 
			of scrapbooking products increased across the United States. In 2005, annual sales 
			flattened for the first time after many back to back years of double growth. From 2006 
			through 2010 traditional scrapbooking sales have declined, while digital forms of 
			scrapbooking have grown. Traditional scrapbooking sales for 2010 have declined to about 
			$1.6 billion in annual sales from a peak of about $2.5 billion in 2005. During that 
			same time frame the number of independent scrapbooking stores declined from a high of 
			4,200 to about 1,200 independent storefronts. The number of scrapbooking manufacturers 
			also declined in that same period from a high of 800 to under 250.</p>

			<p>In addition to the collection of photographs, tickets, postcards, and other memorabilia, 
			journaling is often a principal element in modern scrapbooks. Journaling is text that 
			describes, explains, or accents the photographs on a scrapbook page. Contemporary 
			journaling can take many forms. It can be reflective and story-like, take a reportive 
			tone, or simply be a list of words. Journaling may also include song lyrics, quotations, 
			and poems. The value of journaling lies in the fact that it provides an account of 
			family histories that may otherwise not be preserved.</p>

			<p>Many consider journaling one of the most important elements of any scrapbook.Journaling 
			is a personal choice and it can describe the event, the photographs, or relate feelings 
			and emotions. Handwritten journaling is considered best by some scrapbookers who see 
			handwriting as valuable for posterity, but many people journal on the computer and print 
			it onto a variety of surfaces including vellum, tape, ribbon, and paper.</p>

				<h3>Sketches</h3>

			<p>Scrapbookers will sometimes refer to sketches for inspiration for their pages. Sketches 
			are a hand-drawn layout showing where to position photos, titles, journaling and 
			embellishments. It gives novice scrapbookers somewhere to begin if they are not 
			experienced with balancing the layout correctly. Scrapbookers can interpret the sketch 
			in any way they choose; it is a great starting point when you have scrappers-block. 
			There have been many sketchbooks published and scrapbooking magazines always offer 
			sketches as part of their content.</p>
